                  <p class="leading">The best place to post job
                  descriptions of open positions for perl developers
                  is at <a
                  href="http://jobs.perl.org">jobs.perl.org</a>. This
                  is the main website for people looking for perl work
                  and looking to fill perl jobs. It's an invaluable
                  resource, and local developers check it all the
                  time. The job postings also show up on our <a
                  href="/jobs.shtml">local jobs page</a>.
                  </p>

                  <p class="leading">If the position is local to the
                  Kansas City area, you may also want to have the
                  description posted on our mailing list. Since you
                  can't post to the list unless you're subscribed, you
                  should send them on to the group moderator: Andrew
                  Moore &lt;amoore at cpan dot org&gt; and he will
                  forward them to the rest of the list.

                  <p class="leading">To improve your odds odds of
                  developing interest from qualified local candidates,
                  here are some things that may help you out:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tell us as much about the company as
                        possible. Since you may not want to mention the
                        company name, at least explain how large the
                        company is and what industry it is in.
                      </li>
                      <li>Tell us as much about the team as
                      possible. Is it a large team that has been
                      around for a while? Is it a small and new team
                      that you're looking for someone to lead?
                      </li>
                      <li>Tell as much about the project as possible?
                      Is this a new application that you need someone
                      to design and implement from scratch? Is it an
                      old application that needs to have some large
                      features added to it? Is this mostly maintenance
                      programming?
                      </li>
                      <li>Tell as much as you can about the code
                        itself.  Can you tell us how many lines of
                        code it is? Does it follow any well-defined
                        coding standards? Is it object oriented? Does
                        it run on linux or windows? Under apache, and
                        maybe mod_perl?
                      </li>
                      <li>Can you describe the ideal candidate?</li>
                      <li>Why should I take this position?</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you can address as many of these points as
                    possible, you will have better luck receiving
                    interest to your job posting.
