    <h1>Upcoming Meetings</h1>

    <p class="leading">Meetings are generally the second Tuesday of
    each month at 7pm. We currently meet at <a
    href="http://www.barleysbrewhaus.com/">Barley's Brewhaus</a> in
    Shawnee at 16649 Midland Drive, the southeast corner of Midland
    and Renner, just east of I-435. There's a wider variety of food
    than at our previous meeting location, and they serve
    beer. Underage perl mongers are still allowed in, though, so don't
    let that keep you away. Just look for us in the back, by the pool
    tables. We'll have a couple of hightop tables pushed together.

    <p class="leading">New members are always welcome. Any potential
    attendees are encouraged to check the mailing list to see if we're
    really meeting and to encourage those of us who are forgetful.</p>
